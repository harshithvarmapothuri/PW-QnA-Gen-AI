      "    Tuples are a type of data structure in Python that are similar to lists, but with a few key differences. The main characteristic of tuples is that they are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified or changed after they are created. This is because tuples are stored in a fixed size and cannot be resized. Another characteristic of tuples is that they are ordered, meaning the elements are stored in a specific order and can be accessed by their index. Tuples can also contain any type of data, including other tuples. Overall, tuples are useful for storing data that should not be changed, such as constants or configuration settings.\n",

      "Answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "The two tuple methods in python are count() and index(). The count() method returns the number of times a specified element appears in a tuple, while the index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element. For example, if we have a tuple named \"fruits\" with elements \"apple, banana, cherry, apple\", fruits.count(\"apple\") will return 2 and fruits.index(\"cherry\") will return 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to lists because tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified. This makes it unnecessary to have methods like append() or remove() that modify the tuple. The two methods provided for tuples are sufficient for basic operations like counting and finding elements. Additionally, having fewer methods makes tuples more efficient and faster to process compared to lists, which have more methods and can be modified.\n",

It is defined by curly braces and can be created by passing a list as an argument to the set() function. To remove duplicates from the given list, we can simply convert the list into a set using the set() function. This will automatically remove all the duplicate elements.

      "    A dictionary in Python is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is similar to a real-life dictionary where words (keys) are associated with their definitions (values). An example of a dictionary in Python would be a phonebook, where the names of people are the keys and their phone numbers are the values. Dictionaries are unordered, meaning that the items are not stored in a specific order and cannot be accessed by index. Instead, they are accessed by their keys. This allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of data. However, in Python 3.7 and above, dictionaries are guaranteed to maintain insertion order.\n",

      "    Yes, we can create a nested dictionary in Python. A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary. It allows us to store data in a hierarchical structure, making it easier to access and manipulate. To create a nested dictionary, we can simply assign a dictionary as a value to a key in another dictionary. For example, we can create a one-level nested dictionary to store information about a person's name, age, and address. The code for this would be: \n",
      "    person = {\n",
      "        \"name\": \"John\",\n",

This can be done by using the syntax dict1.setdefault('topics', ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']). If the 'topics' key already exists in the dictionary, the setdefault() method will not change its value. However, if the key does not exist, it will be created and assigned the specified default value. This is a useful method for adding new keys and values to a dictionary in a single line of code.\n",

The keys view object contains all the keys in the dictionary, the values view object contains all the values in the dictionary, and the items view object contains all the key-value pairs in the dictionary. To display these view objects, we can use the in-built methods keys(), values(), and items() respectively.
